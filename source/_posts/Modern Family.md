* Maybe we are the way we are because of the people we are with, or we just pick the people we need. However it works, when you find each other, you should never let go.
* All in all, it was a great vacation. We may have lost a man. But out there on the range, under that great big sky, we found a part of ourselves we never knew was there, just like the horny cowboy said we would. – Phil
* All week long, I’d been telling my girls how to act instead of showing them. But not Phil. Phil could have said: “Alex, relax. Don’t take everything so seriously.” Or “Haley, challenge yourself. Don’t give up so easily.” But instead of talking the talk, Phil walked the walk. And isn’t that what we’re supposed to do for the people we love? It’s definitely a challenge… But Phil made it look easy seven-feet off the ground. Turns out, I’ve had my super Dunphy all along.
* We all struggle with limitations… Some we are willing to accept… And some we are not. It’s never too late to grow in life.
* There are dreamers and there are realists in this world. You think the dreamers would find the dreamers and the realists would find the realists, but more often than not, the opposite is true. You see the dreamers need the realists to keep them from soaring too close to the sun. And the realists… well without the dreamers, they might not ever get off the ground.
* Family is family. Whether it’s the one you start with… the one that you end up with… or the family that you gain along the way… Which makes every day December 16th. —
* They say the important thing in life isn’t the destination. It’s the journey, the challenges you face along the way, the unexpected twists and turns, the disappointments you overcome. But they ar wrong. It’s all about the destination, expecially when the destination is your amazing oceanfront hotel. — Manny
* There’s certain moments in life that you never forget, like when I held Manny in my arms for the very first time. I was nervous. I didn’t know what I was doing. I was so excited to see him grow up. And the more he becomes the little man I know today, the more I know I would do it all over again… which is good, because I/m going to do it all over again. Turns out that I wasn’t carsick. —Gloria
* I’ve always seen life like a series of doors. Sometimes you get to choose the door you go through, sometimes you don’t get that choice. But you still gotta walk through. So you can either go kicking and screaming, or walk through with your head held high. And since I don’t get to choose the door I’m about to go through, I just pray it’s a healthy, happy kid. — Jay
* Making the child is the easy part. The hard part is everything that comes after. Keeping them safe, making sacrifices for them, and standing by them, even when they let you down. —Gloria
* Sometimes I don’t understand people. They do crazy things for the dumbest reasons. They convince themselves it’ll all work out, despite all the evidence to the contrary which I guess isn’t so bad. —Jay
* New Year’s so wried, the way it makes you thinks about time. I thinks that’s why people put so much pressure on themselves to have fun. I mean I guess I sorta get it. Like right now I wish I could just slow down time, cause I am so not ready for hime to grow up yet.—Haly
* Give me the ticket for the car. I’m going after her! This little chicken game may work for your dad, but it doesn’t work for me. Thet’s my little girl. I need her to know that no guy no earth is good enough for her, let alone some slimy, middle-aged jean salesman! — Phil
* There’s all kinds of milestones in life, the kind you expect to live through, the first kiss, birthdays, graduations. If you’re lucky, a wedding or two. Or even a new addition to the family. Then there’s the kind you never dreamed you’d get to live through again. That’s the best kind of all. —Jay
* It’s not what you look at that matters. It’s what you see. — Thoreau
* We all weave a web of lies. Some we tell to try to help the ones we love. Some we tell to try to fool ourselves. And some we tell because when you out of bullets and staring down the barrel of a Kalashnikov, the only weapon you’ve got left is guile. —Manny
* What qualifies someone as a hero? Obviously, a hero has to be someone we respect. Aperson we look up to. A person who is generous of spirit. Who’s will to grow and learn. Maybe it’s the person you love most in the world. Or the guy who makes the most out of life no matter what anyone thinks. For me though, the hero in my family is my family because of who we are together. — Manny
* Sometimes you have one of those days where you are surrounded by people but you still fell pretty lonely. All you want to do is go home to the comfort of your family. But sometimes, even your family can't give you that comfort. Because it turns out they've all had one of those days, too. All you can do is wait for days like that to be over...So you can go to bed and hope you wake up to a better tomorrow. --- Clair
